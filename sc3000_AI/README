# SC3000: Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains my coursework, study notes, and implementation exercises for the SC3000 Artificial Intelligence course at Nanyang Technological University (NTU).

## Course Overview

This course explores the fundamental principles and techniques of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on problem-solving, logic, and learning agents.

### Key Topics Covered

* **Problem Solving & Search:**
    * Uninformed Search (BFS, DFS)
    * Informed Search (A* Algorithm, Heuristics)
    * Adversarial Search (Minimax, Alpha-Beta Pruning)
* **Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP):** Backtracking search and local search techniques.
* **Knowledge Representation:** Propositional Logic and First-Order Logic.
* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Markov Decision Processes (MDP), Q-Learning, and Policy Optimization.
* **Deep Learning Basics:** Introduction to Neural Networks and Backpropagation.

## Practical Implementation

### Assignment: LLM Alignment with Reinforcement Learning
Applied Reinforcement Learning concepts to align a Large Language Model (NanoGPT).
* **Task:** Fine-tuned a character-level GPT model using **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**.
* **Outcome:** Enabled the model to solve arithmetic and algebraic problems by training it on a generated dataset of positive/negative reasoning pairs.
* **Tools:** PyTorch, Transformers.

## Repository Structure

* `assignment/`: Code and documentation for the NanoGPT alignment project.
