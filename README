# NTU Exchange Semester (Aug–Dec 2025)

This repository documents my academic work during my **exchange semester at
Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**, completed between  
**August 2025 – December 2025**.

## Overview
During this exchange semester, I took a range of computer engineering and
computer science courses at NTU, covering **algorithms, artificial intelligence,
machine learning, computer vision**, and **signals and systems**.

The semester emphasized a balance between **theoretical foundations** and
**practical coursework**, including projects, labs, and presentations.

## Courses Taken
- **SC2001 – Algorithm Design and Analysis**  
  Core algorithms course focusing on analysis techniques, sorting, graph algorithms,
  greedy methods, dynamic programming, and computational complexity.

- **SC3000 – Artificial Intelligence**  
  Introduction to fundamental AI concepts and intelligent problem-solving methods.

- **SC4000 – Machine Learning**  
  Machine learning principles, model training, evaluation, and applied coursework.

- **SC4061 – Computer Vision**  
  Image processing and computer vision fundamentals with hands-on assignments.

- **IE2110 – Signals and Systems**  
  Foundational engineering course taken as part of the exchange curriculum.

## Academic Work
Across these courses, the semester included:
- Programming assignments and labs
- Algorithmic and data-driven projects
- Analytical problem solving
- Written reports and **short academic presentations** (typically ~10 minutes)

## Learning Outcome
This exchange semester strengthened my ability to:
- Study and perform in an international academic environment
- Integrate concepts across multiple engineering and computing disciplines
- Apply theory to structured coursework and projects
- Communicate technical work clearly through presentations and documentation
