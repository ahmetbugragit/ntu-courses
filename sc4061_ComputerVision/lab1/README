# SC4061 – Computer Vision | Lab 1

This repository contains my **Lab 1 assignment** for the SC4061 Computer Vision course.

In this lab, I implemented and analyzed fundamental **image processing techniques in MATLAB**, including contrast enhancement, spatial and frequency domain filtering, geometric transformations, and basic color-based object detection. The experiments focus on understanding how different methods affect image quality under various conditions such as noise and perspective distortion.

## Files

- `lab1.m` — MATLAB script implementing all lab tasks.
- `AHMETBUGRAKUS_SC4061_LAB1_REPORT (1).pdf` — Submitted lab report with explanations and results.
- `Lab1 manual.pdf` — Official lab instructions.

## Topics Covered

- Contrast stretching and histogram equalization  
- Gaussian and median filtering  
- Frequency-domain noise removal using FFT  
- Projective transformation (homography)  
- Color-based region detection in HSV space  

## How to Run

Open `lab1.m` in MATLAB, ensure required images are in the same directory, and run the script.
