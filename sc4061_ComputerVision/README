# SC4061 – Computer Vision (NTU, Nanyang Technological University)

This repository contains laboratory assignments completed for **SC4061 – Computer Vision** at **Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**.  
The work is centered on the **core concepts taught in the course**, with an emphasis on understanding *what is learned in computer vision and why*.

## What I Learned in SC4061

The SC4061 course focuses on how computers interpret and analyze visual information. Throughout the course, I learned:

- **How digital images are represented** as intensity and color matrices, and how pixel-level operations affect visual information.
- **Image enhancement techniques**, including contrast stretching and histogram equalization, to improve visibility and dynamic range.
- **Noise modeling and removal**, using spatial filters (Gaussian averaging, median filtering) and understanding their behavior under different noise types.
- **Frequency-domain analysis**, applying the Fourier Transform to detect and suppress periodic interference in images.
- **Image segmentation principles**, learning how to separate foreground and background using global, adaptive, and statistically driven thresholding methods.
- **Otsu’s method**, understanding variance-based optimal threshold selection.
- **Geometric transformations**, including projective transformations (homography) to correct perspective distortion.
- **Color-based analysis**, using HSV color space for robust region detection and object localization.

These topics form the foundation of **low-level and mid-level computer vision**, which are essential for higher-level tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding.

## Lab Implementation

The laboratory assignments translate theoretical concepts into practice using **MATLAB**:

- **Lab 1** focuses on image enhancement, filtering, frequency analysis, and geometric transformations.
- **Lab 2** focuses on image thresholding and segmentation, comparing global and local approaches under different illumination conditions.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a **conceptually grounded understanding of computer vision fundamentals**, aligned with the learning outcomes of NTU’s SC4061 course, supported by practical implementations and analysis.
