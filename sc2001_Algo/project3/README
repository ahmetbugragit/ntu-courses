# SC2001 Project 3 — Algorithm Design & Evaluation

This repository contains our work for **SC2001 Algorithm Design and Analysis – Project 3**.

## Overview
This project focuses on applying algorithm design techniques and evaluating
their performance through **experimental analysis**.

Emphasis is placed on understanding trade-offs between different approaches
and validating theoretical expectations with empirical results.

## What We Did
- Implemented the required algorithms as specified in the project
- Designed experiments to evaluate algorithm performance
- Analyzed results using runtime and/or operation counts
- Interpreted findings and discussed algorithmic trade-offs
- Prepared and delivered a **10-minute presentation** summarizing the work

## Files
- `Project 3.pdf` – Project specification
- `SC2001_proj3.pptx` – **10-minute presentation slides**
- Source code files – Algorithm implementations (if applicable)

## Run
> Refer to the source files for execution details.

## Course
SC2001 / CE2101 / CZ2101 – Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
