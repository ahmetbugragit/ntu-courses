# SC2001 Lab 2 — Algorithm Analysis

This repository contains our work for **SC2001 Algorithm Design and Analysis – Lab 2**.

## Overview
In this lab, we implemented and analyzed algorithmic solutions with a focus on
**performance evaluation and empirical analysis**.

The lab emphasizes understanding how theoretical complexity translates into
real execution behavior.

## What We Did
- Implemented required algorithms in Python
- Tested algorithms on different input sizes
- Analyzed runtime behavior and performance trends
- Discussed results and observations based on experimental data
- Prepared and delivered a **10-minute presentation** summarizing our approach and findings

## Files
- `lab2_a.py` – Algorithm implementation (Part A)
- `lab2_b.py` – Algorithm implementation (Part B)
- `Project 2.pdf` – Lab specification
- `SC2001 Lab 2.pptx` – **10-minute presentation slides**

## Run (Example)
```bash
python lab2_a.py
python lab2_b.py
