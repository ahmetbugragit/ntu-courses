# SC2001 — Algorithm Design and Analysis (NTU)

This repository summarizes my learning and coursework for  
**SC2001: Algorithm Design and Analysis** at  
**Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore**.

## Course Overview
SC2001 focuses on designing efficient algorithms and analyzing their behavior
using both **theoretical techniques** and **empirical evaluation**.

The course progresses from fundamental sorting algorithms to advanced topics
such as graph algorithms, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, and NP-related problems.

## Topics Covered & What I Learned

### Algorithm Analysis Techniques
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Asymptotic notation: **Big-O, Θ, Ω**
- Best, average, and worst-case analysis
- Practical cost models and operation counting

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Heap Sort**
- Trade-offs between comparison-based sorting algorithms
- Impact of recursion, partitioning, and data distribution on performance

### Divide and Conquer
- Recursive problem decomposition
- Merge-based strategies
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple algorithms

### Graph Algorithms
- Graph representations (adjacency list / matrix)
- Graph traversal:
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Topological Sorting** for DAGs

### Minimum Spanning Trees (MST)
- **Prim’s Algorithm**
- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**
- **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**
  - Path compression
  - Union by rank
- Understanding correctness and efficiency of greedy MST algorithms

### Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Dijkstra’s Algorithm**
- Comparison with MST-based approaches
- Limitations and assumptions (e.g., non-negative edge weights)

### Greedy Algorithms
- Greedy choice property
- Proof of correctness using exchange arguments
- When greedy works vs when it fails

### Dynamic Programming
- Identifying overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure
- Bottom-up vs top-down (memoization)
- Table construction and state transition design

### String Matching
- Basic string matching techniques
- Pattern searching and efficiency considerations

### NP and Computational Complexity
- Introduction to **P vs NP**
- NP-complete problems
- Polynomial-time reductions
- Limits of efficient algorithm design

## Projects & Labs
To apply these concepts, several assessed components were completed:

- **Project 1**: Hybrid Merge Sort (Merge + Insertion)
- **Lab 2**: Algorithm implementation and empirical performance analysis
- **Project 3**: Algorithm design and evaluation

Each included implementation, analysis, and a **10-minute presentation** explaining
the approach and results.

## Learning Outcome
By completing this course, I developed the ability to:
- Analyze algorithms rigorously
- Select appropriate algorithmic strategies for different problems
- Understand trade-offs between theory and real execution behavior
- Communicate algorithmic ideas clearly through presentations and reports
