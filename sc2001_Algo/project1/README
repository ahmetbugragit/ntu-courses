# SC2001 Project 1 — Hybrid Merge Sort

This repository contains our work for **SC2001 Algorithm Design and Analysis – Project 1**.

## Overview
We implement a **hybrid sorting algorithm** that combines:
- **Mergesort** for large subarrays
- **Insertion Sort** when subarray size ≤ threshold **S**

The goal is to reduce recursion overhead and improve practical performance.

## What We Did
- Implemented **Hybrid Merge Sort (Merge + Insertion)**
- Implemented **Original Mergesort** for comparison
- Measured:
  - **Key comparisons**
  - **CPU execution time**
- Experimentally determined an **optimal threshold S**
- Compared performance on large datasets

## Key Findings
- Hybrid sort achieves **lower CPU time** than original Mergesort
- Optimal **S** minimizes total cost (merge overhead vs insertion cost)
- Performance gains become clearer for large input sizes
